- 👋 Hello world! This is @AlvaRocruIT
- 👀 I’m interested in navigating the IT ecosystem.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about IT fundamentals; then IT roles; then Programming Languages; then Frameworks and Libraries, and diving deeper to offer a great experience in my recruiting processes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. Want to help me improve my roadmap? I´m always available to take advice from bigger pals.
- 📫 How to reach me: alvargash90@gmail.com 
- 😄 Pronouns:  What am I supposed to write here?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't drink coffee I take mate🧉, my dear.
- 🧐 Serious fact: Still have some trouble telling the left side from the right side.👉🏻👈🏻
