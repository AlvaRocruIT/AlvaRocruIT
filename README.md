- 👋 Hello world! This is @AlvaRockruIT

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about IT fundamentals; then IT roles; then Programming Languages; then Frameworks and Libraries, and diving deeper to offer a great experience in my recruiting processes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. Want to help me improve my roadmap? I´m always available to take advice from bigger pals.
